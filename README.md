# UFOs

## Overview and Purpose
The project utilizes JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to build a dynamic webpage to display and filter UFO sighting data into a table. The webpage offers interactivity to the user and gives the option to filter the data into any combination of categories (date, city, state, country, and shape). By having a dynamic website, information is offered to users in a more appealing and accessible manner.

## Results
Users can filter their search for UFO sightings by using the filter search bar. Users can filter data by any combinations of the search criteria: date, city, state, country, and shape.

## Summary
### Webpage Drawbacks:
There are a few drawbacks in the design of the webpage that need to be addressed: 

1) Case-sensitive search field: the webpage makes use of case sensitive search terms. This possess an issue since there are no instructions to users for how they should enter their filter terms in the search field. This should be resolved by allowing more flexibility in the search term lookups. 
2) Whitespaces: whitespaces also affect the search results. This should be resolved in case the user was to mistakenly enter whitespace after their search term. 

### Design Recommendations:
There are a few recommendations that can be made to improve the overall design of the webpage:

1) Live Data: the webpage would offer more interactivity if it were to include live data for users to search for the latest UFO sightings.
2) Sighting Map: The webpage would offer more interactivity and visual appeal if the data were plotted on a map for users to visually see the counts of UFO sightings. The mapping of UFO data would also be affected by the filter search fields.
